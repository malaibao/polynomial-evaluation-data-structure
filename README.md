# Polynomials Evaluation

A C++ Program to calculate the coefficient and exponent of polynomials using linked list

## Explanation

there are 2 text files containing a number each row.

represents
6x^4 + 3x^2 + 5X

represents
9x^7 + 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 6x^2

adding their coefficient and exponential together becomes
9x^7 + 8x^5 + 10x^4 + 9x^2 + 5x^1
